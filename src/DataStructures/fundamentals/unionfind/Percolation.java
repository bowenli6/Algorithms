     *The model.
     * We model a percolation system using an n-by-n grid of sites.
     * Each site is either open or blocked.
     * A full site is an open site that can be connected to an open site in the top row via a chain of neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites.
     * We say the system percolates if there is a full site in the bottom row.
     * In other words, a system percolates if we fill all open sites connected to the top row and that process fills some open site on the bottom row.
     * (For the insulating/metallic materials example, the open sites correspond to metallic materials,
     * so that a system that percolates has a metallic path from top to bottom, with full sites conducting.
     * For the porous substance example, the open sites correspond to empty space through which water might flow,
     * so that a system that percolates lets water fill open sites, flowing from top to bottom.)
     *<p>
     * The problem.
     * In a famous scientific problem, researchers are interested in the following question:
     * if sites are independently set to be open with probability p (and therefore blocked with probability 1 âˆ’ p),
     * what is the probability that the system percolates? When p equals 0,
     * the system does not percolate; when p equals 1, the system percolates.
     * The plots below show the site vacancy probability p versus the percolation probability for 20-by-20 random grid (left) and 100-by-100 random grid (right).
     * <p>
     * When n is sufficiently large, there is a threshold value p* such that when p < p* a random n-by-n grid almost never percolates,
     * and when p > p*, a random n-by-n grid almost always percolates.
     * No mathematical solution for determining the percolation threshold p* has yet been derived.
     * The task is to write a computer program to estimate p*.
